# Introduction 
This is a repository for a NuGet package. A library containing classes for dealing with ranges of comparable values for common uses across any .NET project.

# Getting Started
There's nothing to it:
1.	Reference the package
2.	Use types the new types in namespaces under the Evoq root
3.	Profit!

# Build and Test
Please ensure that any and all classes you add to this package are very well tested. This is a general package intended for use across many projects. Code must be of the highest quality. 

# Contribute
Add any specialised Range types in the same vein as the types already in the package.

Remember to update the .nuspec file as needed.
